# Java Unit Test Coding Guidelines

## General Principles

- Test for the Wrong Path — Not the Happy Path
- 

## Test Names



## Junit 

## Assertions


## Mocks

- Mock only what is impossible to run (slow external calls, payment gateways).
- But for services, DBs, and logic — use real in-memory or test containers.
