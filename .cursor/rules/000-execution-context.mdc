# Execution Context Rule

- Always assume the project root is the working directory.
- When generating scripts or tasks, prefix commands with paths relative to the repo root (e.g., `./cmd/foo`, `./internal/...`).
- Do not hardcode `$HOME` paths; always use relative-to-root.
- When showing a `make` or `go` command, assume execution from the root:
  - `make test`
  - `go run ./cmd/myapp`
  - `go generate ./...`
