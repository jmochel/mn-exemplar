# Conventional Branch Naming

**Purpose**: Guides the AI to use the Conventional Branch naming standard for all new Git branches.

**Principle**: All new branches must follow the `type/description` format. The description should be concise and use kebab-case.

**Example Branch Names**:

* `feat/add-new-user-auth`: For new features or enhancements.
* `bugfix/resolve-login-bug`: For fixing bugs in the code.
* `hotfix/resolve-production-issue`: For urgent fixes to production issues.
* `release/v1.2.0`: For preparing and testing new releases.
* `chore/upgrade-dependencies`: For non-code-related tasks, such as updating dependencies or documentation.
* `docs/update-readme`: For documentation-related changes.
* `style/reformat-dbt-yml`: For code style changes that don't affect the logic.
* `refactor/improve-payment-flow`: For code refactoring without changing functionality.

**Rule Details**:
- **Type**: Must be one of `feat`, `bugfix`, `hotfix`,`docs`, `chore`, `style`, `refactor`,`release`, `test`, `perf`, or `ci`.
- **Scope (Optional)**: If the change is limited to a specific part of the codebase, include it as `type(scope)/description`.
- **Description**: A short, kebab-cased summary of the changes.
  - Use Lowercase Alphanumerics, Hyphens, and Dots
  - No Consecutive, Leading, or Trailing Hyphens or Dots
  - Include Ticket Numbers: : If applicable, include the ticket number from your project management tool to make tracking easier. For example, for a ticket issue-123, the branch name could be feature/issue-123-new-login.
  - 

**AI Directive**:
When a new branch is being created, ensure the name conforms to the `type/description` or `type(scope)/description` format. Refer to the Conventional Branch specification and remind the user to follow this standard.
